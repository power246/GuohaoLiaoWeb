	<b>Role: Team Leader & Programmer</b>

	This is my experience from a robotics competition I participated in during middle school, where we won a county-level second prize. Although I had some prior experience with robot programming, this was my first time participating in such a formal competition. I remember that the challenge was to design a robot to pick up a target ball from one bucket and throw it into another. Our team had prepared thoroughly for a second competition with a different theme—placing a ring onto a target pole—but due to the pandemic, we were unable to compete.

	Our team had five members, and I served as the team leader and was responsible for programming. As programmers, our main task was to implement all the necessary functions for the robot before the competition, and then adjust specific parameters during the competition. As the team leader, my responsibilities were to coordinate the team's work before the competition, organize practice sessions, and coordinate teamwork during the competition.

	<b>About programming:</b> Initially, we used C# as our programming language, and later we were also allowed to use Python. The core tasks of programming were to control the robot's movement, ball pickup, and ball throwing functions. The robot's movement was controlled through the joystick on the remote. When the y-axis of the joystick changed, the speed of the left and right wheels would adjust together to move the robot forward or backward. When the x-axis changed, the speed of the left and right wheels adjusted separately, allowing the robot to turn left or right. The ball pickup function was achieved using the robot's front tracks to suck the ball into the body. By holding down a button on the remote, the ball would be picked up. The ball-throwing function was accomplished by using gears to pull a rubber band that would launch the ball from the top of the robot. To avoid multiple balls getting stuck in the robot, we set the same button for both ball pickup and ball throwing. During practice, I noticed that the robot's speed was too fast, so I designed a “shift” button. When pressed, it would significantly reduce the robot's speed, allowing for more precise control.

	<b>About the team leader's responsibilities:</b> Before the competition, I had to be aware of each member's progress, such as the building progress of the team members responsible for assembling the robot, and the skill level of those operating the robot. I also organized practice sessions to help improve the coordination between team members. During the competition, I was responsible for coordinating the relationships between the team members. For example, there was an incident during the competition where the operator and the observer had a conflict. The operator controlled the robot, while the observer watched the overall situation and provided suggestions for operations. The conflict arose because the operator did not follow the observer's instructions. To resolve this, I immediately swapped out the observer and temporarily took over the role myself, ensuring the competition continued smoothly. After the competition, I held a small meeting with the operator and the observer, allowing them to calmly discuss their thoughts. After understanding the situation, I explained that their conflict could affect the success of the whole team, and I helped them understand each other's perspectives. The operator explained that, in the tense competition environment, it was difficult to act on the observer's instructions immediately. After they reached a mutual understanding, we never encountered similar conflicts in future competitions.

	In summary, my experience in the VEX robotics competition was a valuable learning opportunity that taught me both technical and leadership skills. As the team leader and programmer, I gained hands-on experience in robot design, programming, and troubleshooting. I learned the importance of communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, especially when handling team conflicts under pressure. Despite the challenges, including the disruption caused by the pandemic, our team's dedication and teamwork enabled us to achieve success. This experience not only strengthened my passion for robotics but also helped me develop skills that are valuable in both technical and leadership roles.
