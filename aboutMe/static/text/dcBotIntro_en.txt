<b>Overview</b>
This project is a music bot for Discord servers that supports playing YouTube audio and offers multiple playback modes. The bot allows users to create playlists and play music in Discord voice channels.

<b>Features</b>
<b>&#8226; Music Playback:</b> Supports extracting and playing audio from YouTube videos (including live streams).
<b>&#8226; Playlist Management:</b> Users can add, remove, and view playlists, with options for sequential or shuffle playback.
<b>&#8226; Playback Modes:</b> Supports single-track playback, playlist playback, single-track loop, and shuffle mode.
<b>&#8226; Basic Controls:</b> Provides essential functions such as join/leave channel, play, pause, resume, and volume adjustment.
<b>&#8226; Multi-language Support:</b> Includes a Chinese version (discord_bot.py) and an English version (discord_bot_en.py).


<b>Tech Stack</b>
<b>&#8226; Backend:</b> Python, Discord.py, yt-dlp (for extracting audio from YouTube).
<b>&#8226; API Integration:</b> Uses Discord API for command control and yt-dlp for audio processing.
<b>&#8226; Deployment (TBD):</b> Can be hosted on Heroku, AWS, VPS, or a local server.

<b>Challenges & Solutions</b>
<b>&#8226; Token Security:</b> The bot token is hidden, and users must manually replace it with their own token to run the program.
<b>&#8226; Playback Mode Management:</b> The current version may not allow switching playback modes while playing, so it's recommended to set the mode before playback.
<b>&#8226; YouTube Audio Extraction:</b> Uses yt-dlp to extract audio streams and FFmpeg for format conversion and playback.

<b>Future Improvements</b>
&#8226; Optimize playback mode switching to allow seamless transitions during music playback.
&#8226; Add more interactive features, such as lyrics display, music search, and automatic recommendations.
&#8226; Support additional audio sources like Spotify and SoundCloud.
&#8226; Enhance error handling to provide more user-friendly error messages and solutions.

This project showcases my skills in Python, Discord bot development, and API integration, and it is continuously being improved!
